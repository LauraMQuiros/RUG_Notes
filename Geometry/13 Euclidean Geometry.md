let $f: \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ be affine and such that
$\exists O \in \mathcal{E}$, $\forall A \in \mathcal{E}$ and $f(A) = O + \lambda(A) \cdot \vec{OA}$
Deduce that f is a scaling (dilation/ho)

isometries, aflections and inversions

1. given two points in a euclid space one can draw a straight line connecting them
related to geodesics
3. to produce a finite line segment writing a line (notion of distance and connotation of finite)
4. to draw circles of arbritary radius and center
related to polar geodesics
6. All right = \pi /2 angles are equal to another
FFF or riemannian metric G(u,v) and at a point you diagonalise + orthonormalise u get I, you get usual euclidean structure at point, so you can consider the angle at a point in tangent spaces. 
6. If alpha and beta are smaller than two right anfles, then the two lines have an intersection in O, for which O is in both lines d1 and d2 that make the two angles w an intersected line D
properties of geodesics highly dependent on topology
8. Given a line D in a euclidean plane and a point p not in D, there exists a line d' through p that is parallel to D

affine geometry: there is no notion of distance, only obliges axioms 1,2,5'
