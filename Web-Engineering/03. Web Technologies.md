# HTML
[[HyperText Markup Language (HTML)]] is default web language, it was in the original web proposal, derived from [[SGML]]. It's used to annotate [[Hypertext]] which is what defines it as a [[Markup]]. It's interpreted by a browser.
```HTML
# content is between opening and closing tag
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p> 
# whole thing is an element, which can be inline or block (newline). 
# Element can be empty
<p class = "editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p> 
# class is an id attribute
# contents of attribute must be on single or double quotation marks
# boolean attributes disabled = "disabled" | ""
```
`<h1>`to `<h6>` hierarchically nested headings, `<p>` is paragraph
`<em>` emphasised, `<strong>` bold: easily understood by browser and engines they have semantics defined by the language itself. 
	Tried w `<b>`, `<i>`and `<u>`but not as good
`<sup>` superscript, `<sub>` subscript, `<code>` for code

Lists: 
1. unordered `<li>`
2. unordered nested under element `<ul>`
3. ordered nested under element `<ol>`
Description lists: pairs of description term `<dt>`and description definition `<dd>` which are elements under element we call `<dl>`. 

Links: `<a>` with href attribute containing target [[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]], title attribute for additional info, also allows for links around `imag` and to different areas of the HTML doc

Images: `<img>` attributes src with [[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]], alt (alternative text description), width and height. 

HTML5: attributes srcset and sizes allow for resolution management and semantic wrapper `<picture>`. Before embedded video/audio was handled by Flash, now `<video>`and `<audio>` elements. attribute controls. 

Tables: `<table>` with `<tr>` as row, `<td>` enclosing cell content, `<th>` header data, `<rowspan>` and `<colspan>`for cells with longer span. Should not substitute layout

Forms
	`<form>` defines interaction point with user as composition of one or more widgets. A [[Native Widget]]
		include text fields, buttons, etc
	The server [[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]] to process the data is defined in the action attribute. HTTP method to be used is in method attribute, default GET
```html
<h2>Contact information</h2> 
<fieldset> 
	<legend>Title</legend> 
	<ul> 
		<li> 
			<label for="title_1"> 
				<input type="radio" id="title_1" name="title" value="Mr."> Mister 
			</label> 
		</li> 
		<li> <label for="title_2"> 
			<input type="radio" id="title_2" name="title" value="Ms."> Miss 
			</label> 
		</li> 
	</ul> 
</fieldset>
```
We have a big fieldset element described by legend, in this element label describes the input element which defines the type and value of the form element

We need to validate client information sent to the server. Two validation types: 
1. Client-side, through javascript, in the browser before submitting
2. Server-side, through application logic

Document structure

[[Wrappers]]: like `<span>` or `<div>` inline and block non-semantic elements, vague functionality, mainly decoration
```html
<nav> 
	<ul> 
		<li><a href="#">Home</a></li> 
		<li><a href="#">Our team</a></li> 
		<li><a href="#">Projects</a></li> 
		<li><a href="#">Contact</a></li> 
	</ul> 
<!-- A Search form is another commmon non-linear way to navigate through a website. --> 
	<form> 
		<input type="search" name="q" placeholder="Search query"> 
		<input type="submit" value="Go!"> 
	</form> 
</nav> 
<!-- Here is our page's main content --> 
<main> <!-- It contains an article --> 
	<article> 
		<h2>Article heading</h2> 
		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, ...
```
`<nav>` provides navigation inside it
`<form>` is used to navigate 
`<main>` is where the actual content goes

# CSS
[[Cascading StyleSheets (CSS)]] specifies how document are presented to users with a collection of CSS rules, applied to an HTML document to define how is it displayed
	Properties: values set to update HTML content for display
	Selector: which elements to apply the property values to

[[CSS Selectors]]: define HTML elements for styling in groups
	- simple
	- based on attributes
	- pseudo-classes of elements in state
	- pseudo-elements as group of content elements in a position with respect to a given element
	- combinators and multiple selectors
```css
p{
	color: red;
}
```

[[Document Object Model (DOM)]] represents the document structure as a tree. Browser displays DOM contents. Browsers come w default sheet to apply to all pages

External stylesheets: 
```html 
<html> 
	<head> <meta charset="utf-8"> 
		<title>My CSS experiment</title> 
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h1>Hello World!</h1> 
		<p>This is my first CSS example</p> 
	</body> 
</html>
```
```css
h1 { 
	color: blue; background-color: yellow; border: 1px solid black; 
} 
p { 
	color: red; 
}
```
Internal stylesheets: 
```html
 <html> 
	 <head> <meta charset="utf-8"> 
		 <title>My CSS experiment</title> 
		 <style> 
			 h1 { 
				 color: blue; 
				 background-color: yellow; 
				 border: 1px solid black; 
			} 
			p { 
				color: red; 
			} 
		</style> 
	</head> 
	<body> 
		<h1>Hello World!</h1> 
		<p>This is my first CSS example</p> 
	</body> 
</html>
```
Inline declarations of the form `<h1 style="color: blue;background-color: yellow;border: 1px solid black;">` should be avoided

[[Inheritance]]: some properties are automatically inherited to children elements, otherwise only gets the initial value. This can be controlled by the inherit and initial attributes
[[Cascade]]: resolves potentially conflicting rules that manipulate same element in an incompatible manner. 
![[cssPriority.png | 300]]

They do so by prioritising the setting given by the developer, then user and then user-agent or browser. Also by prioritising any rule containing the "!important" attribute, then the specificity (how many elements can match) and then source order (later added rules get priority)
``` css 
#myApp [id=“myElement”] { color: yellow; /* yellow wins over #myElem*/ }
#myElement { color: green; /* green wins over .body class*/ } 
.bodyClass { color: yellow; }
p { color: green; }
```
```html
<p> This paragraph has green text except from the <em style=“color=purple”>emphasized text</em> that is purple.</p>
```

# Static vs Dynamic Pages

[[Static Web Pages]]: sets of HTML+CSS documents given to client by HTTP server. Content is predefined, forms are allowed
[[Dynamic Web Pages]]: enable rich interaction model with the client by supporting dynamic content to be served. Started with server-side content generation which now has been shifted to client-side.

History of server-side content generation
	[[Common Gateway Interfaces (CGI)]]: allow web servers to talk to back-end programs (in any language) and generate HTML in response
	[[Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)]]: set of [[Common Gateway Interfaces (CGI)]]s in c extended with web form management and database communication
	[[Java]] servlets or [[JavaServer Pages (JSP)]]: software components written for server but ends beng used to implement web containers by embedding HTML in Java code. JPS generates pages similarly to PHP by embedding Java code in HTML
	[[ASP.NET]]: microsoft .NET equivalent
	[[Django]], [[Flask]], [[Ruby on Rails]], [[Express.js]], [[Laravel]]...

Client-side dynamic pages
`<script>` element
JavaScript as a high-level scripting language
[[Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)]]
	- browsers aka clients can make requests without reloading
	- they can receive and process data from the server
	- builds on [[XMLHTTPRequest (XHR)]] objects
	- can retrieve any type of data
	- can retrieve sync or async
	- supports listening
	- responses are [[Document Object Model (DOM)]] representing [[XML]] documents
jQuery simplifies [[Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX)]]

Fetch API: 
	interface for fetching resources to be implemented by the browser
	manages `Request` and `Response` objects
	Actually fetching a resource through the fetch() method 
	Returns a Promise object that eventually resolves into a Response
``` java
const request = new Request('https://example.com', {method: 'POST', body: '{"foo": "bar"}'}); 
const url = request.url; 
const method = request.method; 
const credentials = request.credentials; 
const bodyUsed = request.bodyUsed;

fetch(request) 
	.then((response) => { 
		if (response.status === 200) { 
			return response.json(); 
// Actually a second promise to parse the response body into JSON 
		} else { 
			throw new Error('Something went wrong on API server!'); } });
```

[[MultiPage web Applications (MPA)]] minimise client-side behaviour. 
[[Single Page Applications (SPA)]] are heavily client-side dynamic web pages. Frameworks for this include [[Angular]], [[React]] and [[Vue]]. [[Server-side Rendering (SSR)]] for [[Single Page Applications (SPA)]] can be quite nice. [[Angular]] is supported by [[Angular Universal]], [[Next.js]] for [[React]] and [[Nuxt.js]] for [[Vue]].

![[mpa_VS_spa.png | 400]]

[[Content Management Systems (CMS)]]: allows users to create content without coding
[[Static Site Generators]]: dynamically generate webpages of MPA apps server-side, may include JavaScript rendered by the server
