[[Web Engineering]]: uses approaches from multiple disciplines, we have to ensure maintenance and functionality is delivered over the web
[[Web]]: an information system for the retrieval of resources identified by URLs connected by [[Hyperlinks]] accessible over the [[Internet]]. Defined as a unique hostname.
[[Resources]]: any type of [[Hypermedia]] but mainly [[Hypertext]]
[[Hyperlinks]]: 
[[Internet]]: network infrastructure (not the web)
[[Hypertext]]: concept referring to text with links to other texts (like a table of contents)
[[Hypermedia]]:  concept referring to any kind of media connected to each other by links

Organising

# Foundations of the Web
![[02 - Web foundations.pdf]]

### Internet

[[Socket]]s: Berkeley invented, transmission over [[TCP]] 
[[PointOfPresence]]: devices towards each cable is going. Receives all requests and puts it in the internet network provider
[[Internet Service Provider]]s: offer connectivity
[[Internet eXchange Point]]s: peer [[Internet Service Provider]]s so they can all communicate with each other's connected devices

### URI s
[[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]]s: reference identifying an abstract or physical resources
how useful it is depends on the purpose of the URI
	
[[URL]]: locator. Subset of URI that identifies resources for their primary access mechanism. Physical address or resource.
	https has port 443 and non-https has port 80

[[URN]]: name. Subset of URI that identifies a resource independent of its primary storage location. It's a logical address that remains even after the resource is moved around
	contains representation of the data without all the html stuff

## HTTP

## Part 01: Basic Concepts
[[HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]]: [[Hypertext]] Transportation protocol in which the internet is based on. Every pair of request/response is a separate, new connection. 
	Reliable because no state is maintained doesn't rely on previous communication. Also, connections can persist.

[[Pattern]]s: recurrent solution to a common problem
[[Client-Server Pattern]]: one side is the client aka User-Agent which sends the requests, one side is the server which answers. 
[[Origin Server]]: server where the response resides
[[Proxy]]: program that acts on behalf of an origin server, maybe to check credentials. The client has to be aware that their request is being processed by the proxy and it needs to ensure that the proxy is representing a server that has the answer they are looking for and is redirecting the request properly.
[[Gateway Server]]: client thinks they talk to the origin server but usually redirects and transforms
[[Tunnel]]: program acts as a relay between two connections, helps to avoid firewalls

[[Content Negotiation]]: When resources are available in multiple representations the specific representation to be given to the client is provided by the [[Content Negotiation]] mechanism.
[[Server-driven]] [[Content Negotiation]]: Client gives some headers. Server will give it what it decided is best next thing, but as the request does not detail purpose, it may not be in the client's best interest
[[Client/agent-driven]] [[Content Negotiation]]: server gives available variants and the clients chooses the best. It can influence decision and blends well with scripting but requires 2 roundtrips for a single request
[[Transparent]] [[Content Negotiation]]: no one uses it but it kinda does the first and the server gives options + recommended option so it's potentially 2 trips but may be only be 1
## Part 02: Messages & Methods

[[Ethernet]]: [[Hypercard]] to hypercard, uses [[MAC-address]]. 
Message structure (in BNF) 
	1. `HTTP-message = request-line | status-line message-header* CRLF message-body?`
	2. `message-header = general-header | entity-header | request-header | response-header`
	3. `(general | entity | request | response)-header = field-name ":" field-content CRLF`
	4. `general-header = Cache-Control | Connection | Date | Pragma | Trailer | Transfer-Encoding | Upgrade | Via`
	5. `entity-header = Allow | Content-Encoding | Content-Language | Content-Lenght | Content-Location | Content-MD5 | Content-Range | Content-Type | ETag | Expires | Last-Modified`

[[Transfer-Encoding]]: 
[[Via]]: if message is sent through (says that the response is not from an origin server)
[[Content-MD5]]:you should have received this fingerprint pls check they are the same to look for external interference
[[Expires]]: expire date of messages

HTTP Request Message
	1. `request = request-line (general-header | request-header | entity-header)* CRLF message-body?` 
	2. `request-line = method SP requestURI SP HTTP-Version CRLF //SP=space` 
	3. `HTTP-Version = "HTTP" "/" DIGIT ("." DIGIT)?` 
	4. `requestURI = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority`
	5. `method = "OPTIONS" | "GET" | "HEAD"| "POST" | "PUT" | "DELETE" | "TRACE" | "CONNECT" | extension-method` 
	6. `request-header = Accept | Accept-Charset | Accept-Encoding | Accept-Language | Authorization | Expect | From | Host | If-Match | If-Modified-Since | If-None-Match | If-Range | If-Unmodified-Since | Max-Forwards | Proxy-Authorization | Range | Refer | TE | User`

[[Host]]: mandatory!!

## Request URIs
Everytime you open the browser, usually accessed websites will be fetched, and because the garage door was opening 
synchronising bookmarks: thumbprint ??
[[Idempotent]] requests: will consistently and deterministically change the state of the world.  
[[Safe]] requests: the requests that don't affect the state of the world. We are responsible to make all get requests safe.

`PUT`: ask the client to give the url where the new resource, used for both insert and update
`POST`: ask the server to accept/update the (new) resource, give me handler 
`GET`: request data from a specified resource

# Caching 
[[Caches]]: makes web works at scale
[[Web Accelerator]]: pre-fetching proxy deployed by either [[Internet Service Provider]] or other. They also do compression, bc they probably never gonna show most of them to the client. Talks to other proxies. 
[[Internet eXchange Point (IXP)]] for example may have [[Edge Caching]] which does sth 
[[Response Cache]]: 
[[Application Host]]: lookup tables may be being used, holds the whole logic of the app. 
Some [[Proxy]] are also [[Caches]]. 
1. [[Forward Proxy]]. What we've seen so far, several proxies are covering for one single server
2. [[Reverse proxy]]. Instead of one server, several servers and one proxy that redirects the request to the proper one. Load distribution.

[[Cache Consistency]]: cached copies must be on sync with original resource
	timestamps for expiry: 
	validity check: 
[[Content delivered networks]]:
