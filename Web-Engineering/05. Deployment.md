[[Containers]]: light-weight [[Virtual Machine (VM)]], another process that is inside the linux kernel by default. It has 

1.lifecycle
```terminal
docker run -it ubuntu::22:04 bash 
# interactive ubuntu instance version
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 nginx # expose port 80 in host port 8080
# rm is remove after finished
docker run -v $(pwd):/data mysql # mount current directory at data in container
docker stop/kill/rm
docker ps -a # show running containers w/o a, w all closed containers
```
2.docker image
```
docker run -it ubuntu::20.04 bash
... # we do some apt install
docker commit <name>
docker tag <layer> <image name>
docker image ls
```
A dockerfile will result in the same image 
``` dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22-.04
RUN apt install python
COPY * /src
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "/src/main.py"]
$> docker build . -t <image name>
services: 
	mariadb:
	image: mariadb:11.2
# they run docker compose up 
# docker compose up -d mariadb (name of the servers you wanna deploy)
# docker compose down 
```
copy the csproj will give description of files and dependencies so that when the file is updated, the dependencies affected are re-executed
move dir to docker `copy[".", "./"]` 
```dockerfile
FROM build as publish 
RUN dotnet publish "Movies.csproj" -o /app

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS FINAL 
# allows for less downloading if we use multi-stage build sdk AS build
WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 80
COPY --from=publish /app
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet","Movies.dll"]
```
