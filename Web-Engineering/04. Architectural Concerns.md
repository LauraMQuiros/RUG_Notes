# Architectural Model

_Let's introduce two concepts: first, functional organisation units (application layers) and second, physical organisation units, tiers._

[[Application Layers]]: functional organisation units, organisation system of an application consisting in logically separated components, which divide the responsibilities of an application. The layer only depends in the layer beneath it (hierarchical order).

[[Tier]]: physical organisation units. They are physical or logical separation of these components across different levels of the architecture. 

[[Layered Architecture pattern]], aka n-[[Tier]] architecture is the pattern using [[Application Layers]]. 
	Usually it uses 3 basic layers (3-tier) 
1. Presentation (aka User Interface) Layer 
	Rendering/presenting data, user input handling, user interface, communication/ conversation logic
2. Application (aka Business) Logic Layer
	functions offered via presentation layer, logic performed by application layer, core logic
3. Resource (aka Data Access aka Persistence) Layer
	logic to access data needed by application logic, database, files, content, queues, support functions

_What are thin and thick clients in terms of how much logic the client layers use?_
[[Thin Client]]: little to no presentation logic (browsers without JS)
[[Thick Client]]: may host presentation logic part
	[[Single Page Applications (SPA)]] or [[MultiPage web Applications (MPA)]], built on top of APIs, application logic on client delegates some processing to function on server. Access via high-level interface to resources, provides location transparency of resources

_Okay, we saw a 3-tier [[Layered Architecture pattern]], and two types of clients. Let's see other types of architectures and patterns._
Often front-end (screen), middle-tier (cpu, gpu) and back-end or persistence (server, memory). Each tier may contain several layers.
	[[Client-Server Pattern]] is a 2-tier model, because it usually uses two devices or modules with their own layers. One of this modules may be a thin or thick client.
	Basic 2-[[Tier]] app: thin client model. Centralised applications with clients acting as dumb terminals, effectively [[Monolithic app]], static websites no JS, only HTML
	3-[[Tier]] app: commonly confused with application layers
	n-[[Tier]] app: orthogonal cuts (layer encapsulation) to the layers.

Now your app may be across different devices and use different layers. This is a very common design pattern using the layer concept to make 3 layers in an unknown number of devices

[[Application Layers Topology]]: there are different arrangements or configurations in which the layers can be structured within a system.
	1. [[Monolithic app]]: self-contained behaviour, single unit deployment, all-in-one development, difficult to scale operations and development. Is a tightly coupled architecture, where all layers are interdependent and run on the same physical or virtual machine.
	2. [[Client-Server Pattern]] (as architectural style): client layer is responsible for the presentation and user interaction, while the server layer handles the application logic and data storage.

## Design Patterns
[[MV* Patterns]] 

-  [[Model View Controller (MVC)]]
![[MVC.png | 600]]
	Many frameworks allow for model grouping in collections, views build and maintain [[Document Object Model (DOM)]] elements, templates for View as [[HyperText Markup Language (HTML)]] to avoid over-generating
	Benefits: Easier maintenance, unit testing, DRY principle and parallel development due to decoupling

- [[Model View Presenter (MVP)]]
![[mvp.png | 600]]
	Presenters instead of controllers which allows for a decoupling of the View/presenter due to the communication through interfaces. Most commonly implemented with [[Passive View]] (little to no logic). 
	Benefits: increased testability and modularity, presentation logic reuse across MVs

- [[Model View ViewModel (MVVM)]]
![[MVVP.png| 600]]
View Model encapsulates the business logic with View dealing with formatting of data
	Validation actually done by Models 
	ViewModel as specialised Controller: data converter

Main differences: 
1. [[Model View Presenter (MVP)]] and [[Model View ViewModel (MVVM)]] are derivatives of [[Model View Controller (MVC)]] with key differences in layer's dependencies and positioning
2. [[Model View Controller (MVC)]]: view is on top with direct access to models, which means that there is less complexity, more security issues and performance costs
3. [[Model View Presenter (MVP)]]: Presenters are on the same level as Views, mediating between Views and Models. It requires Views to implement Presenter interfaces
4. [[Model View ViewModel (MVVM)]]:  ViewModels allow for View-specific subsets of Models, not required to reference a View.  There is less logic required for the View but we require interpretation between VM and V which leads to performance costs

## Service Oriented Architecture

[[Heterogeneity]]: ability to support and integrate with diverse systems, applications, and services, irrespective of the platform or technology used
[[Fault tolerance]]: ability of an SOA system to continue operating correctly, even when errors occur

[[Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)]]: architectural paradigm (style) for the realisation and maintenance of business processes that span large distributed systems. Goal: to provide flexibility by supporting [[Heterogeneity]], decentralisation and [[Fault tolerance]]

Services: Encapsulated functionality abstractions, exposing clearly defined interfaces, obscuring the internal implementation details
Infrastructure: combines services in easy and flexible manner

Policies and processes that deal with [[Heterogeneity]], changeability and multiple ownership of large distributed systems
[[Interoperability]]: ability to easily connect systems, as exemplified by [[Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)]]
[[Loose coupling]]: minimisation of dependencies between systems leads to [[Fault tolerance]], flexibility and scalability. Not binary relation with tight coupling: different degrees of coupling may be present in one system

[[Service Constituents]]
1. Interface: Functionality visible to the external world. Means to access this functionality. Self-descriptive definition so that it's easy to understand
2. implementation: Realises specific service interface(s). Multiple languages/platforms can be used. May use other services to implement functionality

- - -

![[Operations in SOA.png | 300]]
[[Interaction Roles]]
1. Provider: Organisation that owns the service and implements the underlying business logic. The platform hosting and controlling access to the service
2. Consumer/client: An organisation requiring certain functionality to be satisfied. An application or service that uses the service
3. Registry: Searchable directory where services are described. Clients can “discover” suitable services and get all necessary information to use them

Operations: Publish (description, registration), Find (discovery, selection), Bind (direct or indirect invocation)

## WS-* vs [[RESTful API]]
[[Web Services (WS)]]: software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL).

Weaknesses

|               | WS-*                                                                         | RESTful                                                                      |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.            | Leakage across abstraction layers is common when existing components are transformed into services | Many proxy servers and firewalls allow only POST and GET, requiring non-standard workarounds |
| 2.            | Interoperability issues also arise in the implementation of the WS-* standards, especially the earlier ones | Safe requests (using only GET) having large amounts of input data are often impossible to encode in the URI  |
| 3.            | Translation between XML and object-oriented language constructs leads to performance inefficiencies | No commonly accepted mechanism for the marshalling of complex data structures     |
