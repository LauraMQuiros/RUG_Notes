# [[REpresentational State Transfer (REST)]]

![[REST Architecture.png]]
 
 Architectural style for building large-scale distributed hypermedia systems
 Defines a set of constraints and defines the web as an instance of its style
 1. REST cannot be implemented, only adhered to
 2. It was defined/distilled from the Web a posteriori
 3. RESTful systems don't have to be in the Web
 

Constraints: 
1. [[Resource Identification (RI)]] through [[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]]s. Anything named can be a resource, like the state, pages or others
2. [[Uniform Interface (UI)]] through HTTP verbs 
	Example [[Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete (CRUD)]]
3. [[Self-Describing Messages (SDM)]] (provides data and metadata in representation such as field names, types and links)
	Resources are abstract entities â†’ cannot be used as is, only identified (RI) and accessed (UI)
4. [[Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)]]: the server has more access control over resources by sending hypermedia links.  RESTful applications do not call but navigate
5. [[Stateless Interactions (SI)]]: resource state separated from client state, no client state storage in the server, server manages resource state, no server state. Resource state is in resource representation. 
	Cookies are an alternative. A cookie is sent from the server to the user containing the state of the resources or the current session, side effects include:
	1. deprecated representations bc of link change
	2. computationally expensive tracking (performance-heavy)
	3. global/ cross-resource (cookies are stored globally and may be accessed by multiple resources)
	4. load balancing to be cookie-aware( load-balancer examines cookie and reroutes accordingly)
	Another alternative is [[Resource-based state]]

Goals: 
1. performance: [[Resource Identification (RI)]],  [[Uniform Interface (UI)]] and [[Caches]]
2. scalability 
	[[Caching]] allows serving requests without accessing origin server
	All the required state is contained in the request response
		[[Server Affinity aka Sticky Session]]: always send requests to same server so session state is updated consistently
		[[Load-balancing]]: requests are sprayed across clustered servers
1. simplicity: user-friendly, [[Uniform Interface (UI)]]
2. data independence: multiple formats per resource for user choice of representation, [[Self-Describing Messages (SDM)]]

# Maturity Levels of REST Applications
Richardson Maturity Model

Level 0: [[Plain Old XML (POX)]] this is NOT RESTful
	[[HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]] is the transport system for remote interactions, [[Tunnel]]ing mechanism for [[Remote Procedure Call (RPC)]], doesn't take advantage of HTTP verbs 
Level 1: [[Resources]]
	Interactions target resources identifiable by [[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]] in message bodies with data and metadata
Level 2: [[HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]] verbs and metadata helps id [[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]]
Level 3: [[Hypermedia]] control by introducing [[Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)]] and [[Stateless Interactions (SI)]]. Provides representation to next valid state change operations on the link (link to next thing to do) and [[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]] of the resource, which can be dynamically changed. There is no universal standard of hypermedia control representation.

# API design
[[Application Programming Interface (API)]]: set of signatures that are exported and available to the users of a library or a framework to write their applications. Should include statements about program's effects and/or behaviours.

[[RESTful API]]s [[Design Principles]]
1. Information abstraction of a key element constitutes a resource
2. Resource representation is a sequence of bytes , plus representation metadata; the representation is negotiable
3. All interactions are context-free aka state agnostic ([[Stateless Interactions (SI)]])
4. Idempotency of operations (multiple identical requests have same answer) and representation of metadata is encouraged
5. Presence of intermediaries is encouraged

## Conventions
> [!Info] Rule formulation
> SHOULD NOT/NOT RECOMMEND: there may be valid reason to accept a particular behaviour but full implications must be considered
> SHOULD/RECOMMEND: there may be valid reasons to ignore an item but full implications must be considered

Interface: 
[[Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)]] format: 
`/` indicates hierarchical relationship 
`-` and lowercase for naming
file extensions are not included, use consistent subdomains
singular nouns for document names or single resources
plural nouns for collections or stores (client-managed resource repos)
verbs for executable functions (controllers) and should not use [[Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete (CRUD)]]. They should be with POST. 
`?` query component for filtering or pagination

Interactions: 
`GET` must not be used to [[Tunnel]], must retrieve representation of resource
`PUT` must be used to insert resources in the server or update any mutable resources
	Stores, which are inside the client, must support conditional `PUT` requests)
	Syncing? The server replies to any PUT request with a status code and 
`POST` must be used to create a new resource in a collection and execute controllers
`DELETE` must be used to remove a resource from its parent


Metadata: `Content-Type, (Content-Length, Last-Modified,) Location, (Cache-control, Expires, Date)` 
Custom HHTP headers must not be used to change the behaviour of HTTP methods

No standard for [[Client Versioning]]
Distinguish between major non-compatible and minor compatible APIs, indicated by number in the version.

# Design
Choices you regret down the line

Define data model: not same as the one exposing to the rest of the world. What do the users see, identify the resources. Every input and output of the data model is a resource, an object
	
Split data into Resources: 
Name resources with URIs: 
representation of what you receive as input and output
no obligations to implement all methods
Link between resources: and add to representation
usual workflow
Error conditions: 

HTTPS verbs: GET, DELETE, 
`POST`: new entity. Go to /movies to go to movies `POST /movies` you post to collection
`PUT`: new entity with a specific URL no post to a collection. Also update resource 
`PATCH` idk 
we don't need all of them sometimes

1. investigate data set
2. design api models (not same as database models bc consumption is different, you want one query, all info)
3. design api endpoints 
4. flesh out model

# API specification

Machine-readable description, can generate documentation. 
Is recommended to provide [[API Specification]] which defines what the API offers and how to interact with it

- - -

`GET` usually tries to fetch a document, the conditional request can be used to send back the document, if relevant only
