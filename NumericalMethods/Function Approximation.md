The first topic will be [[Function Approximation]] in the sense of equations which doesn't have exact solutions can have a computer calculated approximate solution. Some examples are:
$$\begin{align}e^x + x = 2 \rightarrow e^x= 2-x \rightarrow x= \ln(2-x) \\ \int^1_0 \sin(x^2) dx \\ y\prime (x) = y^2(x) + x, \ y(0)=1 \\ Ax= b \\ \phi_t = k \phi_{xx} \ \text{where k is the heat diffusion constant} \end{align}$$
