# [[Parabolic PDE]]s
PDEs being [[Partial Differential Equations]] that describe things like heat conduction, temperature, diffusion, time-dependence of concentrations, viscous effects... etc. 
For example this is a diffusion equation for variable $u=u(x,t)$ with diffusion coefficient $D$ $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$ however, it may also be the heat diffusion coefficient $\kappa = \frac{\lambda}{\rho C_p}$ for heat conduction coefficient $\lambda$, density $\rho$ and specific heat $C_p$.

Is important to keep in mind both temporal initial conditions such as at $t=0, u(x,0) = \phi(x)$ and spatial boundary conditions such as $u(0,t)=U_L(t), u(L,t)= U_R(t)$ for spatial coordinates $x \in [0,L]$

# Stability, Consistency

The discretisation is [[Consistent]] with the [[Parabolic PDE]] when the difference between them $\rightarrow 0$ for $\Delta x \to 0, \Delta t \to 0$. This difference is expressed in the [[Local Truncation Error]], which is the order of $\Delta t, \Delta x$ thrown away for approximation given a discretisation and method. 

For example, spatial explicit discretisation has $T(m\Delta x, n\Delta t)= \mathcal{O}(\Delta t, \Delta x^2)$. This doesn't mean convergence just yet, since we need $u^n_m \to u(x,t)$ for  $\Delta x \to 0, \Delta t \to 0$ for that.

[[Stability]]: errors in initial and boundary conditions shouldn't grow too fast. Coefficients must be $0 \leq r \leq \frac{1}{2}$ so choose $\Delta t, \Delta x$ appropriately. If stable, convergent. In fourier analysis: no Fourier component of the numerical solution should grow faster than the fastest possible growth of the exact solution.

[[Convergence]]: a scheme is convergent if $\epsilon^n_m := u^n_m - u(m\Delta x, n\Delta t) \to 0, \Delta x \to 0, \Delta t \to 0$ and it happens if we have [[Stability]].

[[Lax Equivalence Theorem]]: If a numerical scheme is consistent with the differential equation (i.e., the schemeâ€™s truncation error goes to zero as the step sizes go to zero) and is stable, then it is guaranteed to converge to the true solution as the grid is refined.

## Discretisation 

1. [[Spatial Discretization]]
Technique to approximate the second derivative via relations between $u$-values at mesh points (as already introduced in [[Matrix-vector methods]]). 
First we make $M$ intervals in the range $[0,L]$ so that $\Delta_x = L/M$, such that the mesh points go from $1:M+1$ 
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} (X_m,t) = \frac{u(x_{m+1},t) +2u(x_m,t) +u(x_m,t)}{\Delta x^2} + \mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2)$$
We can neglect the higher order terms because the second order accurate approximation because for sufficiently small $\Delta x^2$, the higher orders are negligible.
Spatial discretisation function $u$ has to have the temporal and spatial initial conditions as mentioned in the [[Parabolic PDE]]s section but this time for $u(t=0), u_0, u_{M+1}$ 

2. [[Explicit Time Discretization]]
At each time $t= (n+1)\Delta t$ we can approximate $$\frac{d u_m}{dt} (t) = D \frac{u_{m+1}(t) -2u_m (t) + u_{m-1}(t)}{\Delta x^2} = f(u_{m-1}, u_m, u_{m-1})$$ which for example for an explicit euler method $u_m^{n+1}= u^n_m + \Delta t f(u_{m-1}, u_m, u_{m-1})$ will be $$u^{n+1}_m = r u^n_{m-1}+ (1-2r) u^n_m +ru^n_{m+1}$$ for $r= \frac{\Delta t D}{\Delta x^2}$ 

3. [[Implicit Time Discretization]]
When using implicit euler $u^{n+1}_m = u^n_m + \Delta t D \frac{u^{n+1}_{m+1} -2u^{n+1}_m +u^{n+1}_{m-1}}{\Delta x^2}$ with same $r$ value and final eq $$\begin{align} -r u^{n+1}_{m+1} + (1-2r) u^{n+1}_m - r u^{n+1}_{m+1} &= u^n_m \\ -u^{n+1}_{m+1} + (1/r-2) u^{n+1}_m - u^{n+1}_{m+1} &= u^n_m/r \end{align}$$Same as explicit: 1st order convergence in time and 2nd order spatial convergence. Consistent. The amplification factor $\frac{1}{1+4r \sin^2 (b\Delta_x /2)} <1$ for all $r > 0$ so implicit is unconditionally stable. Because it's stable and consistent, according to [[Lax Equivalence Theorem]], it will converge.
We can also make this system of equations into a linear system 
$$\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 & & \\
-1 & 2+ 1/r & -1 \\ & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \\ & & -1 & 2+1/r & -1 \\ & & & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \\ & & & & - 1 & 2+1/r & -1 \\ & & & & & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} u^{n+1} \\ u_2^{n+1} \\ \vdots \\ u^{n+1}_m \\ \vdots \\ u^{n+1}_M \\ u^{n+1}_{M+1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} U_L(t) \\ \frac{1}{r} u^n_2 \\ \vdots \\ \frac{1}{r} u^n_m \\ \vdots \\ \frac{1}{r} u^n_M \\ U_R(t) \end{pmatrix}$$

# [[Crank-Nicholson]]
[[Implicit Euler Method]] is only 1st order linear convergence, but we can improve it with the [[Trapezoidal Rule]] $\frac{u^{n+1}_m - u^n_m}{\Delta t}$ such that our resulting difference equation is $$ \begin{align} -r u^{n+1}_{m+1} + (2-2r)u^{n+1}_m - ru^{n+1}_{m+1} &= ru^n_{m-1} + (2-2r)u^n_m + ru^n_{m+1} \\ - u^{n+1}_{m+1} + (2/r-2)u^{n+1}_m - u^{n+1}_{m+1} &= u^n_{m-1} + (2/r-2)u^n_m + u^n_{m+1} \end{align}$$ this has a 2nd order both spatial and time convergence, can also be put in a linear system and might allow higher $\Delta t$ (less computation time) with equal or better results due to its 2nd order convergence.
