Tasks: detecting (points/pounding boxes/polygons), classification, instance segmentation (pixel-wise classification), self-supervised learning

What is the difference between semantic segmentation and instance segmentation? Instance classifies appearances of different classes separately, instead of just classifying the pixel

Different PhD projects: 
1. Trees in pointclouds: Canopy high model tells apart different heights for different trees, then creates a from-above grid of trees. Problem: misses trees below
2. Crown bounding boxes in satellite images, DINO_SWIN was the best perform, [[DINOÂ (self-distillation with no labels)]] is a self-supervised learning method that directly predicts the output of a teacher network - built with a momentum encoder - using a standard cross-entropy loss.
3. Species classification
4. Individual tree crown delineation in satellite and aerial images QGIS
5. Palms detection 
6. Self-supervised learning goal + unlabeled + loss function, masked autoencoders
