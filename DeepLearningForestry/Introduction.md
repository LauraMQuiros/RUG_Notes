Observations we take at specific place may be influenced by location an surrounding, like building is influenced by terrain or a road will be influenced by the population of the city

[[Remote Sensing]]: observation, mapping and interpretation of phenomena on the Earth's surface or other surfaces w/o initially entering these areas. Encompasses all methods that enable the non-contact scientific observation and exploration of an area from a distance

[[Electromagnetic Spectrum (EM)]]: from ultraviolet to infrared, only the wavelength range for which the atmosphere is transmissive can be recorded from satellite sensors ([[Atmospheric Window]]). So there's a specific spectral range for each sensor

[[Multispectral Sensors]]: split incoming white light into components that refer to different portions of the [[Electromagnetic Spectrum (EM)]]. So components are recorded separately and each one build one [[Band aka channel aka Image layer]]. This is [[Multilayer Imaging]] ??

[[Electromagnetic Components]]: 

[[Spatial Resolution]]:

[[Spectral Resolution]]:

[[Radiometric Resolution]]:
