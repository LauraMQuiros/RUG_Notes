[[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]]: Focuses on 
1. design and analysis of computational algorithms and representations for processing natural human language. 
2. Automating the analysis, generation, and acquisition of human (“natural”) language.

Is interdisciplinary: combines [[Computational Linguistics]], [[Machine Learning (ML)]], and [[Deep Learning (DL)]] to process human language
Goal is to enable computers to process human language in text or voice data and ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment

[[Part Of Speech (POS) tagging]]: assigning part-of-speech tags to each word in a text (verb, noun, ...). Tagging is a disambiguation task.
